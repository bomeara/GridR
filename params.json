{"name":"GridR","tagline":"Enabling Grid execution for R","body":"### GridR and Bosco\r\nUtilizing GridR and Bosco, you can submit remote processing from within your R environment, whether it is [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) or the R command line to clusters on your campus or on national infrastructure such as the OSG or XSEDE.\r\n\r\nGridR and Bosco can expand the realm of possibilities for your R processing.  By moving R processing to remote clusters, your R workflows can run hundreds or thousands of simultaneous calculations, all managed from your laptop.\r\n\r\n### Quick Example\r\n\r\nUsing GridR and Bosco, you write the code on your laptop, and let the cluster do the heavy lifting.\r\n\r\n    # Initialize\r\n    library(GridR)\r\n    grid.init(service=\"bosco.direct\", localTmpDir=\"tmp\")\r\n \r\n    # boring function (replace with real work)\r\n    a <- function(s) { return (2*s) }\r\n \r\n    # Send the function to the remote cluster, wait for the result\r\n    grid.apply(\"x\", a, c(1:10), batch=c(1))\r\n \r\nWith this code, you wrote the function and the inputs, and sent the function `a` to the cluster to be executed 10 times.  After the calculations have completed, the output will be stored in the variable `x`.  It was that easy to submit calculations to a remote cluster!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Quick Install\r\n\r\nYou can quickly install and try out Bosco + GridR using the [quick install](https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/CampusGrids/BoscoR).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSupport is provided by the @osg-bosco team.
